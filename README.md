# SBSPS-Challenge-971-AI-Powered-Recruiter-Bot

EXISTING PROBLEM:

Students go to a particular place to give tests and interviews which is difficult for some students in particular situations like COVID-19 pandemic, etc. The recruiter also faces many problems as they have to select some students from a large number of students.  

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

We have created a chat-bot that will filter students which will make it an easier task to recruit students from already filtered students. This chat-bot will also help students by telling them about their performance in the aptitude test and interview test. Also, students will get an idea about which questions are asked in the test and interview which gives some idea to students how they can prepare.
